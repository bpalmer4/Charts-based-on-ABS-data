    " * $\\epsilon$ is the error term in the various equations, which is normally distributed around zero\n",
    "\n",

    " \n",
    "  * Only using two historical inflation terms (and not three) in the price inflation equation. The RBA uses three. This is because the beta3_pi term was not significantly different to zero.\n",
    "  * Similarly, the $\\lambda_{pi}\\frac{(U_{t-1} - U_{t-2})}{U_t}$ term was not used in the price inflation equation, as it did not produce a statistically significant $\\lambda_{pi}$ parameter.\n",
    "  * The use of the global supply chain price index during the COVID-19 period (2020Q1 to 2023Q2) is an addition to the RBA model (hat tip to Zac Gross for first exploring this approach).\n"
