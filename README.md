# Charts-based-on-ABS-data

A series of Jupyter Notebooks, coded in Python, to produce charts
based on data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
The charts cover key social and economic statistics. 

Each notebook should get the latest ABS data and produce a suite of
charts in the charts directory. 

Note: the directory structure is a little unusual. It is
designed to work on an iPad using the carnets app. 

To run a notebook, 
* fire-up Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
* navigate to the notebooks directory
* select the notebook you wish to run
* run with the double arrow (restart kernel and re-run the whole notebook)
