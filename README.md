# Charts-based-on-ABS-data

Originally a series of Jupyter Notebooks, coded in Python, to 
produce charts based on data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
These notebooks have been expanded to include data from the 
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS).

The charts cover key social and economic statistics. 

Each notebook should get the latest data and produce a suite of
charts in the charts directory. 

Note: the directory structure is a little unusual. It is
designed to work on an iPad using the carnets app.
